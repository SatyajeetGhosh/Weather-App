<h1>Weather App</h1>

<p>Developed a Weather App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The web app is responsive and can viewed in devices with varying screen sizes without any difficulty.</p>

<h2>About the Web App</h2>

<p>
    The Web App displays the following weather conditions of a city:
    <ul>
        <li>Temperature</li>
        <li>Type of weather</li>
        <li>Humidity</li>
        <li>Wind speed</li>
    </ul>

   The user can select any city of his/her choice to know about the weather conditions there. The web app shows the weather conditions of Bengaluru by default.

<p>Used OpenWeather API to fetch data about the weather. To know more about the API <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">click here</a>.</p>
    
<p>This API can fetch current weather data for any location including over 200,000 cities. This API collects and processes weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations. I used the city name parameter to fetch the information about the weather condition of the city.</p>
